The dataset is from direct marketing campaigns(phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit (variable y).
Built machine learning models using Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest Classifier, K nearest Neighbour Classifier, and Naive Bayes Algorithm and compared them using the evaluation metrics score.

Problem Statement :
The project I am working on involves analyzing data from a Portuguese bank's phone-based marketing campaign to determine if clients are likely to subscribe to a term deposit. The bank made multiple phone calls to clients to see if they were interested in the term deposit, and my task is to predict whether or not a client will subscribe based on the data you have. I will use classification techniques to make this prediction.
